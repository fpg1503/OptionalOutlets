You should restart Xcode after that.

# What does this do?

The primary goal of this plugin is to make `@IBOutlet`s `Optional`. By default, Xcode uses `ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional`s, but that's dangerous and even though you can safely unwrap them most people don't. The secondary goal is to make your `@IBOutlet`s `private`. Using outlets outside a class is a code smell and seldom is needed. This plugin automatically makes your outlets `Optional` and `private`, simple as that! Don't worry, they are independent rules and you can disable them at any time.

- [@chrisfsampaio](https://twitter.com/chrisfsampaio) for adding support to making outlets `private`, adding an example project, adding feature toggles, reporting bugs and a bunch of other stuff I probably forgot to mention.
- [@orta](https://twitter.com/orta) for blogging about [his experience on building a Xcode plugin](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/06/17/building-the-xcode-plugin-snapshots/).
- [@kattrali](https://twitter.com/kattrali) for providing a [template for Xcode plugins](https://github.com/kattrali/Xcode-Plugin-Template).
- [@gsampaio](https://twitter.com/gsampaio) for telling me to throw the Swift version of this plugin away, copy Fabri's and save ~8Mb for all the users.
